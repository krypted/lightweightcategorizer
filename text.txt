What are ConfoundsConfounds, also known as confounders, are the compounding variables found in research studies. To start from the beginning, a confounding variable is any outside influence that can change the effect of an independent or dependent variable. The word confound is defined as, “causing surprise or confusion in someone; especially by acting against their expectations”. Therefore, just as it sounds, a confounding variable is an extra variable that was likely not accounted for when researching initial results.In research studies, a confounder is something that might be causing or affecting the results being studied. If confounders are not accounted for, it could render the results of the research useless. Since many research studies look at the correlation between two factors, i.e., the cause and effect, researchers need to be certain than outside influences are not actually causing the correlation.Let’s look at an example. Let’s say that researchers are trying to find out if there is a correlation between weight loss and exercise. They study a group of people and ask them to exercise three times a week for six weeks. At the end of the study, they measure the results. An overlooked factor, or confounding variable, here is food. Without taking food consumption into account, the results would be inconclusive. Some may eat less to try and lose weight and others may eat more to compensate for the added exercise. If this confounder isn’t considered, the results of the study will likely be useless.In controlled trials, most confounding variables can be eliminated. However, they still should be considered. In observational research or surveys, confounding variables are essential to consider for accurate data. Since research is not being done in a controlled environment, all outside factors must be measured and noted. Whichever research method is employed, confounds need to be accounted for and eliminated when possible.
